microstrategy-js
================

A collection of javascripts written to achieve custom MicroStrategy dashboard visualization

With the MicroStrategy HTML container, you add your own custom HTML code to the documents and dashboards. This allows us to include libraries like jQuery to manipulate and enhance user experince using custom javascripts.

To use the scripts, simply download the file and place it in your javascript folder in your MicroStrategy Web, then include the following code in an HTML container. 

<script type="text/javascript" src="../javascript/inGridGraph.js"></script>

Alternatively, you can also point the src to the git file here if your enviornment allows.
